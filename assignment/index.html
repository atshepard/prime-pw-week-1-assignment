    <ul>
      <li>Every time I have ever made macaroni and cheese from a box, I have to fish the box out of the garbage like an animal because I forget to read the instructions. </li>
      <li>I really like to read, but never make time for it, so I must not like it <i> that</i> much.</li>
      <li>I think about pushing my code to github like I'm quicksaving in a video game.</li>
